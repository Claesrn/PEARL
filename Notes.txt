Interpreter:
    The updated Interpreter is able to run programs, that before ran out of memory e.g. ARL-Symbol_rule 

    TODO:
        - Interpret the URTM -> to ensure the translated URTM works

    Interpretation of URTM - Total Steps: 0, Total Jumps: 2_832_192_305, Combined Total: 5_664_384_610
    Interpretation of URTM^-1 - Total Steps: 0, Total Jumps: 3_330_242_695, Combined Total: 6_660_485_390

Partial evaluation:

    PE takes a long time, URTM ran for 6 days and no result -> expecting having to run for a month+

    TODO: 
        - PE smaller program e.g Apply Symbol
        - PE the URTM

Overall TODO:
    - Fix the reversiblity problems


Zoom call the 7. of january:
    Need to flip the order of the program to get same amount of steps (Sequentially scanning through)


Notes 3. Feb
        Specialed programs yield same amount of steps :D
            - Go through experiment with increment
        
        Spec(int, p^-1) of the URTM:
            Before: 3331480 steps
            After : 22170 steps

        Spec(int^1, p) currently processing.
