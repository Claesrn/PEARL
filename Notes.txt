Interpreter:
    The updated Interpreter is able to run programs, that before ran out of memory e.g. ARL-Symbol_rule 

    TODO:
        - Interpret the URTM -> to ensure the translated URTM works

    Interpretation of URTM - Total Steps: 0, Total Jumps: 2_832_192_305, Combined Total: 5_664_384_610
    Interpretation of URTM^-1 - Total Steps: 0, Total Jumps: 3_330_242_695, Combined Total: 6_660_485_390

Partial evaluation:

    PE takes a long time, URTM ran for 6 days and no result -> expecting having to run for a month+
